# web-scraping


Web Scraping is as simple as the data extraction from a website. I did a simple data extraction from http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/page-1.html using library from Python named BeautifulSoup, you can check here https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ for the detail. The data that I extract are title, price, and rating of the book.

As a result, I store the data in a dataframe, so it can be used easily for the information of price and rating each book.
